  A modular, open templating system, designed for use with `mix gen`.

  You care about this if:

  ① you'd like different templates than the ones built in to mix,
  ② you'd like to create your own templates, or
  ③ you have created a package such as Phoenix or Nerves that needs
     its own project setup.
